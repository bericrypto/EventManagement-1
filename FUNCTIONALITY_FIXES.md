# üîß Functionality Fixes - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Fixed all role-based functionality issues across the Event Management System to ensure proper API endpoint usage based on user roles (PLANNER, STAFF, CLIENT).

---

## üéØ Issues Fixed

### 1. **View Events Component** - Role-Based API Calls

#### Problem
- All users were calling the same `GetEvents()` endpoint (STAFF endpoint)
- PLANNER and CLIENT users couldn't see events due to wrong API

#### Solution
Modified `view-events.component.ts`:

**Get Events Method:**
```typescript
getEvents() {
  const role = this.authService.getRole;
  let eventsObservable;
  
  if (role === 'PLANNER') {
    eventsObservable = this.httpService.GetAllevents();
  } else if (role === 'CLIENT') {
    eventsObservable = this.httpService.GetAlleventsForClient();
  } else {
    eventsObservable = this.httpService.GetEvents(); // STAFF
  }
  
  eventsObservable.subscribe(...);
}
```

**Search Events Method:**
```typescript
searchEvent() {
  const role = this.authService.getRole;
  
  if (isNaN(searchTerm)) {
    // Search by Title
    if (role === 'PLANNER') {
      // /api/planner/event-detail/{title}
      this.httpService.getEventsByTitle(searchTerm);
    } else if (role === 'CLIENT') {
      // /api/client/event-detailsbyTitleforClient/{title}
      this.httpService.GetEventdetailsbyTitleforClient(searchTerm);
    } else {
      // /api/staff/event-detailsbyTitle/{title}
      this.httpService.GetEventdetailsbyTitle(searchTerm);
    }
  } else {
    // Search by ID
    if (role === 'PLANNER') {
      // /api/planner/event-details/{id}
      this.httpService.getEventById(Number(searchTerm));
    } else if (role === 'CLIENT') {
      // /api/client/booking-details/{id}
      this.httpService.getBookingDetails(Number(searchTerm));
    } else {
      // /api/staff/event-details/{eventId}
      this.httpService.GetEventdetails(Number(searchTerm));
    }
  }
}
```

#### Impact
‚úÖ PLANNER can now view all events  
‚úÖ STAFF can view all events (read-only)  
‚úÖ CLIENT can view available events  
‚úÖ Search works correctly for all roles

### 2. **Booking Details Component** - Already Working

#### Status
‚úÖ **No changes needed** - Component is already properly configured

**Features:**
- Loads user's bookings on init with `getMyBookings()`
- Search by event ID or title using client-specific endpoints
- Displays booking status, event details, and allocated resources
- Client-specific data isolation

**API Endpoints Used:**
- `GET /api/client/my-bookings` - Get logged-in client's bookings
- `GET /api/client/booking-details/{id}` - Search by ID
- `GET /api/client/event-detailsbyTitleforClient/{title}` - Search by title

---

### 3. **Resource Allocation Component** - Already Working

#### Status
‚úÖ **No changes needed** - Component is already properly configured

**Features:**
- Loads all resources with pagination
- Loads all events for selection
- Validates resource availability before allocation
- Prevents allocation of unavailable resources
- Real-time availability checking

**API Endpoints Used:**
- `GET /api/planner/resources` - Get all resources
- `GET /api/planner/events` - Get all events
- `POST /api/planner/allocate-resources?eventId={id}&resourceId={id}` - Allocate

**Validation:**
```typescript
onResourceSelect(event: any) {
  const selectedResourceId = event.target.value;
  const selectedResource = this.resourceList.find(
    r => r.resourceID == selectedResourceId
  );
  this.selectedResourceUnavailable = selectedResource 
    ? !selectedResource.availability 
    : false;
}
```

### 4. **Add Resource Component** - Already Working

#### Status
‚úÖ **No changes needed** - Component is already properly configured

**Features:**

- View existing resources with pagination
- Success/error messaging
- Form validation

**API Endpoints Used:**
- `POST /api/planner/resource` - Add new resource
- `GET /api/planner/resources` - Get all resources

---

### 5. **Dashboard Component** - Enhanced with Statistics

#### Status
‚úÖ **Fully Enhanced** - See DASHBOARD_FEATURES.md for details

**Features:**
- Role-based dashboard views

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Failed to load events"
**Cause:** Wrong API endpoint for user role  
**Solution:** Fixed with role-based endpoint selection in getEvents()

### Issue: "Search not working"
**Cause:** Using wrong search endpoint for role  
**Solution:** Fixed with role-based search in searchEvent()

### Issue: "No events showing for PLANNER"
**Cause:** Was calling STAFF endpoint  
**Solution:** Now calls /api/planner/events

### Issue: "CLIENT sees all bookings"
**Cause:** Backend needs to filter by username  
**Solution:** Backend already filters via Authentication object
